# QuietQuest

## Application Summary
Navigating urban enviroments creates unique challenges for individuals with sensory sensitivities, such as visual difficulties and autism. This web application is designed to seamlessly aid this target group in finding a route through Manhattan that avoids busy and noisy areas. Alongside the applicationâ€™s primary function of navigation assistance, it boasts advanced features such as heat maps highlighting predicted crowded zones and the ability to store favourited destinations in user accounts. Central to the development strategy of the application was its optimisation for both desktop and mobile platforms, a quality crucial for a travel companion tool.

## First Setup
On the first run, you might have to install all the python packages. Inside the *backend* directory run:

### `pip install -r QuietQuest_requirements.txt`

On the first run, you might have to install all the node modules. Inside the *frontend* directory run: 

### `npm install`

In the *backend/quietquestapp* directory, you will need a file called *info.py* that has the API key for open
route service in the format: ors_key = "API_KEY"

Also in the *front/quietquestapp* directory, you will need a file called *.env* that has the API key for Firebase for the user accounts, the API key for OpenWeatherAPI and the API key for StadiaMap in the followingformat: 

Firebase:  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...  
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...  

OpenWeatherAPI:  
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=...

StadiaMap:  
REACT_APP_TILELAYER_API_KEY=...

## Running Production

Inside the *frontend* directory of the project, run:

### `npm run build`

Then, inside the *backend* directory of the project, run:

### `python manage.py collectstatic`

Then run, still inside the *backend* directory:

### `python manage.py runserver`

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the site in the browser.

## Database Setup
First try the above instructions, if you are getting an error you may have to set up the database rather than just 
pulling it from the branch as the db.sqlite3 database may be empty. This means you may need to populate it yourself 
with the Noise_Lat_Long.csv. 

**DO NOT DELETE** the *__init__.py* file in the directory below.
Start by deleting all the *numbered* files in the *backend/quietquestapp/migrations* directory, e.g. 0001_initial.py.

Then delete the *db.sqlite3* file in the *backend* directory. 

Inside the *backend* directory run each of these commands in the terminal to recreate the database from the data.

Start with running:

### `python manage.py makemigrations`

Then run:

### `python manage.py migrate`

To populate the 3 databases (this may take a lot of time to finish as the files are quiet large), run:

### `python manage.py runscript populate_databases`

The application should have all the data required to run now.
